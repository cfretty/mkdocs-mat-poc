# Next steps

Let's have a happy little tree in here. How to paint. That's easy. What to paint. That's much harder. Don't be afraid to make these big decisions. Once you start, they sort of just make themselves.

## Learn

Just go out and talk to a tree.

* Make friends with it.
* You can't make a mistake.
* Anything that happens you can learn to use - and make something beautiful out of it.

## Scale up

With practice comes confidence. There comes a nice little fluffer. Get away from those little Christmas tree things we used to make in school.

## Secure

You can spend all day playing with mountains.

## Optimize

I thought today we would make a happy little stream that's just running through the woods here. If we're gonna walk though the woods, we need a little path. In your imagination you can go anywhere you want. It just happens - whether or not you worried about it or tried to plan it.

## Collaborate

Let's get crazy. Now, we're going to fluff this cloud. You got your heavy coat out yet? It's getting colder.

## Contribute

It all happens automatically. You need the dark in order to show the light. See there, told you that would be easy. Get tough with it, get strong.
