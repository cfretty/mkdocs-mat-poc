# Get started

Sometimes you learn more from your mistakes than you do from your masterpieces. A tree needs to be your friend if you're going to paint him. Let's do it again then, what the heck. And just raise cain.

## First thing's first

Maybe there's a happy little waterfall happening over here.

1. You have freedom here.
2. The only guide is your heart.
3. Now we'll take the almighty fan brush.
    1. Each highlight must have it's own private shadow.
    2. Let's just drop a little Evergreen right here.
4. We'll put all the little clouds in and let them dance around and have fun.

``` py
import subprocess
 
def find_installed_packages():
    result = subprocess.run(['pip', 'list'], capture_output=True, text=True)
    package_list = result.stdout.split('\n')[2:-1]
    installed_packages = [package.split(' ')[0] for package in package_list]
    return installed_packages
 
# Example usage:
installed_packages = find_installed_packages()
print("Installed packages:")
for package in installed_packages:
    print(package)
```

### Put light against light

...you have nothing. Put dark against dark - you have nothing. It's the contrast of light and dark that each give the other one meaning. All you have to do is let your imagination go wild.

Just think about these things in your mind - then bring them into your world. A big strong tree needs big strong roots. The only thing worse than yellow snow is green snow.

## More information

* Let all these little things happen.
* Don't fight them. Learn to use them.
* So often we avoid running water, and running water is a lot of fun.
* Just let this happen. We just let this flow right out of our minds.
* If it's not what you want - stop and change it. Don't just keep going and expect it will get better.
